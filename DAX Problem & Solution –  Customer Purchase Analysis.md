# DAX Problem & Solution ‚Äì01- Customer Purchase Analysis

This repository contains a Power BI case study focused on solving key customer analytics problems using DAX functions such as `ADDCOLUMNS`, `SUMMARIZE`, and `SUMMARIZECOLUMNS`.

##  Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of the following tables:

- `Customer`  
- `Product`  
- `Region`  
- `Sales`  

These tables are related appropriately in the Power BI data model to perform sales and customer analysis.

This visual represents the Power BI data model used in this case study. It illustrates the relationships between the key tables: Customer, Product, Region, and Sales.

‚û°Ô∏è The Sales table serves as the central fact table, containing transaction-level data.

‚û°Ô∏è It connects to the Customer, Product, and Region tables via one-to-many relationships, enabling efficient filtering and aggregation.

‚û°Ô∏è This star schema design supports optimal DAX performance and simplifies complex analytical calculations.

‚û°Ô∏è The well-structured data model ensures accurate and efficient customer purchase analysis using DAX measures and calculated tables.

##  DAX Problems to Solve

Using **`ADDCOLUMNS`** and **`SUMMARIZE`**, solve the following:

## ‚ùì01 - Customer Purchase Analysis

This section focuses on analyzing customer purchasing behavior using DAX in Power BI. Below are the key sub-questions explored in this analysis:

1. **Customers with Only One Purchase**  
   > What is the count of customers who made just one purchase?

2. **Churned Customers**  
   > How many customers did not return in the current year?

3. **New Customers in the Current Year**  
   > How many customers made their **first-ever** purchase in the current year?

4. **Repeat Customers (Year-over-Year)**  
   > What is the number of customers who made purchases in **both** the current year and the previous year?

5. **Average Products per Sale**  
   > What is the average number of products purchased per transaction?

6. **Re-solve All of the Above Using `SUMMARIZECOLUMNS`**  
   > Re-implement the above calculations using the `SUMMARIZECOLUMNS` function  
   > (instead of `SUMMARIZE` or `ADDCOLUMNS`) to improve performance or clarity.

1. **Customers with Only One Purchase**  
   > What is the count of customers who made just one purchase?

```dax
1E-SUMMARIZE-Customer only purchased one = 
COUNTROWS (
    FILTER (
        ADDCOLUMNS (
            SUMMARIZE ( Sales, Sales[CustomerKey] ),
            "No of Purchase", CALCULATE ( DISTINCTCOUNT ( Sales[SalesOrderNumber] ) )
        ),
        [No of Purchase] = 1
    )
)


```
2. **Churned Customers**  
   > How many customers did not return in the current year?
   
```dax
 
2E SUMMARIZE-Lost Customer(This year) 2 = 
COUNTROWS(
    FILTER(
        ADDCOLUMNS(
            SUMMARIZE(Sales, Sales[CustomerKey]),
            "Max Order Date",
            FIRSTNONBLANKVALUE(
                Sales[CustomerKey],
                MAX(Sales[OrderDate])
            )
        ),
        [Max Order Date] < DATE(2022, 1, 1)
    )
)
```


3. **New Customers in the Current Year**  
   > How many customers made their **first-ever** purchase in the current year?

```dax
3E SUMMARIZE-New customer in 2022 = 
COUNTROWS (
    FILTER (
        ADDCOLUMNS(
            SUMMARIZE(Sales, Sales[CustomerKey]),
            "First Purchase Date", 
            CALCULATE(MIN ( Sales[OrderDate] ))
        ),
        [First Purchase Date] >= DATE ( 2022, 1, 1 )
    )
)


```
4. **Repeat Customers (Year-over-Year)**  
   > What is the number of customers who made purchases in **both** the current year and the previous year?


```dax

4E SUMMARIZE-Repeat Customer 2 = 
COUNTROWS (
    FILTER (
        ADDCOLUMNS(
            SUMMARIZE(Sales, Sales[CustomerKey]),
            "First Purchase", 
            CALCULATE(MIN ( Sales[OrderDate] )),
            "Last Purchase", 
            CALCULATE(MAX ( Sales[OrderDate] ))
        ),
        [First Purchase] < DATE ( 2022, 1, 1 )
        && [Last Purchase] >= DATE ( 2022, 1, 1 )
    )
)

```
5. **Average Products per Sale**  
   > What is the average number of products purchased per transaction?


```dax
5E SUMMARIZE-Average Product Per Sale 2 = 
AVERAGEX (
    ADDCOLUMNS(
        SUMMARIZE(Sales, Sales[SalesOrderNumber]),
        "No Of Product", 
        CALCULATE(DISTINCTCOUNT(Sales[ProductKey]))
    ),
    [No Of Product]
)
