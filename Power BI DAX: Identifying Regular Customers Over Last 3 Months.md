## ✅ Solution 15: Regular Customer Count (Last 3 Months)

```dax
Regular Customer Count = 
VAR Month1 =
    CALCULATETABLE ( VALUES ( Orders[CustomerID] ) )

VAR Month2 =
    CALCULATETABLE (
        VALUES ( Orders[CustomerID] ),
        DATEADD ( 'Calendar'[Date], -1, MONTH )
    )

VAR Month1_2 =
    INTERSECT ( Month1, Month2 )

VAR Month3 =
    CALCULATETABLE (
        VALUES ( Orders[CustomerID] ),
        DATEADD ( 'Calendar'[Date], -2, MONTH )
    )

RETURN
    COUNTROWS ( INTERSECT ( Month1_2, Month3 ) )

```
Explanation:

Month1: Customer IDs for current month

Month2: Customer IDs for last month

Month3: Customer IDs for two months ago

Final result: Count of customers present in all 3 months

## ✅ Solution 16: Regular Customer Names and IDs (Last 3 Months)


```dax
Answer16_explanation_Regular CustomerName = 
VAR Month1 =
    CALCULATETABLE ( VALUES ( Orders[Customer name] ) )
    -- Creates a table of unique 'Customer name' values from the 'Orders' table for the current month (based on the filter context)

VAR Month2 =
    CALCULATETABLE (
        VALUES ( Orders[Customer name] ),
        DATEADD ( 'Calendar'[Date], -1, MONTH )
    )
    -- Creates a table of unique 'Customer name' values for the previous month (1 month before the current context)
    -- 'DATEADD' shifts the date by -1 month (relative to the current date in the 'Calendar' table)

VAR Month1_2 =
    INTERSECT ( Month1, Month2 )
    -- Finds the intersection (common customers) between the current month ('Month1') and the previous month ('Month2')
    -- The result is a table of 'Customer name's who have placed orders in both the current and the previous month

VAR Month3 =
    CALCULATETABLE (
        VALUES ( Orders[Customer name] ),
        DATEADD ( 'Calendar'[Date], -2, MONTH )
    )
    -- Creates a table of unique 'Customer name' values for the month before the previous month (i.e., two months ago)

RETURN
    CONCATENATEX ( INTERSECT ( Month1_2, Month3 ), Orders[Customer name], ", " )
    -- Finds the intersection (common customers) between the set of customers who ordered in both the current and previous month ('Month1_2') 
    -- and the customers who ordered two months ago ('Month3')
    -- The final result is a concatenated string of 'Customer name's who have placed orders in all three months (current, previous, and two months ago), 
    -- separated by commas
