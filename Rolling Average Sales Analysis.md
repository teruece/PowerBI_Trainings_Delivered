##  What is a Rolling Average?

A **rolling average** (also called a **moving average**) is a technique used to smooth out fluctuations in time-series data by calculating the average value over a specific number of past periods (like months or years).

This approach:
- Reduces noise in volatile data
- Highlights long-term trends
- Helps with forecasting and planning

## ‚úÖ Solution 19: Rolling Average for the Year

```dax
Yearly RollingAverage = 
VAR Periods =
    DATESBETWEEN (
        'Calendar'[Date],
        EOMONTH ( MIN ( 'Calendar'[Date] ), -12 ) + 1,
        MAX ( 'Calendar'[Date] )
    ) 
RETURN
    IF (
        MAX ( Sales[OrderDate] ) <> BLANK (),
        DIVIDE (
            CALCULATE ( [TotalSale], Periods ),
            CALCULATE (
                DISTINCTCOUNT ( 'Calendar'[MonthName] ),
                Periods
            )
        )
    )
```

## ‚úÖ Solution 20: Rolling Average Sales (Last 6 Months)

```dax
Answer20_6Months RA = 
VAR Periods =
    DATESBETWEEN (
        'Calendar'[Date],
        EOMONTH ( MIN ( 'Calendar'[Date] ), -6 ) + 1,
        MAX ( 'Calendar'[Date] )
    )
VAR Runnintotal =
    CALCULATE ( [TotalSale], Periods )
VAR MOnths =
    CALCULATE ( DISTINCTCOUNT ( 'Calendar'[MonthName] ), Periods )
RETURN
    IF ( [TotalSale] <> BLANK (), DIVIDE ( Runnintotal, MOnths ) )
